  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This book series revolves around a number of prophecies that are given to young dragons(dragonets). Every 
      series has a new prophecy, and each series has 5 books. There is a decent amount of violence, the first 
      book being tho most. You should only read this series if you are at least in grade 4. There is some 
      amount of comedy, which I think is a very good thing.This book specifically shows the how the dragons are
      slowly understanding each others religion, wihtout discrimination or wars. And obviously, a lot of adventure. A lot. So leas
      dive right into the reveiw!
